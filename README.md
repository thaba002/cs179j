s.py is the code to detect stop lights. Run it with the command python s.py

stoplight.py creates a stoplight that s.py can detect and ensure that it works.

The stop signs folder contains a folder full of stop signs and ML_test.py. This code does not work and was a failed attempt to get keras/ tensorflow wworking on my computer.
